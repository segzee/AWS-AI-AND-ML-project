    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The project folder has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the main directory you have this notebook, `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb`, that contains the instruction and some questions you will have to answer. Follow this notebook and complete the required sections in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the `src/` directory you have several source files. As instructed in this notebook, you will open and complete those files, then come back to this notebook to execute some tests that will verify what you have done. While these tests don't guarantee that your work is bug-free, they will help you finding the most obvious problems so you will be able to proceed to the next step with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes you will need to restart the notebook. If you do so, remember to execute also the cells containing the code you have already completed starting from the top, before you move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"static_images/icons/noun-info-2558213.png\" alt=\"?\" style=\"width:25px\"/> Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut.  Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubric contains _optional_ \"Stand Out Suggestions\" for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the \"Stand Out Suggestions\", you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing and training a CNN from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will create a CNN that classifies landmarks.  You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although 50% may seem low at first glance, it seems more reasonable after realizing how difficult of a problem this is. Many times, an image that is taken at a landmark captures a fairly mundane image of an animal or plant, like in the following picture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just by looking at that image alone, would you have been able to guess that it was taken at the Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii?\n",
    "\n",
    "An accuracy of 50% is significantly better than random guessing, which would provide an accuracy of just 2% (100% / 50 classes). In Step 2 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to greatly improve accuracy by using transfer learning to create a CNN.\n",

    "The images are resized using T.Resize(256) in the training transform and T.Resize(256) followed by T.CenterCrop(224) in the test transform. This means that images are initially resized to have a shorter side of 256 pixels, and in the case of test images, a central crop of size 224x224 is taken after resizing. The resizing helps standardize the input sizes for the neural network.\n",

    "Color Jittering: Adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue (T.ColorJitter).\n",
    "Horizontal and Vertical Flipping: Images are randomly flipped horizontally and vertically with a probability of 0.5 (T.RandomHorizontalFlip and T.RandomVerticalFlip).\n",
    "Random Crop: A random crop of size 224x224 is taken from the resized image with reflection padding (T.RandomCrop).\n",
